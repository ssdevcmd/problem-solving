//Problem 26: Destructure and Rename  [Easy]
//Description: Given a user object, use destructuring to extract firstName, lastName, and age, renaming firstName to name.
//Example:
//const user = {firstName:'Sara', lastName:'Khan', age:25};// Extract: name='Sara', lastName='Khan', age=25
//Hint: Use: const { firstName: name, lastName, age } = user;

const user = {firstName: 'Sara', lastName: 'Khan', age: 25};
const { firstName: name, lastName, age } = user;
console.log(name);
console.log(lastName); 
console.log(age);
